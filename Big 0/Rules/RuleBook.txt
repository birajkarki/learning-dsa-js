Rule Book

Rule 1: Worst case
Rule 2: Remove constants
Rule 3: Different terms for inputs
Rule 4: Drop Non Dominants

These rules are not strict rules, and sometimes there may be exceptions or different approaches to analyzing time
complexity depending on the specific algorithm or problem. However, they provide a useful framework for simplifying and
comparing the time complexity of algorithms.
